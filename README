This allows you to migrate your django schema using .sql or .py
files in a /db directory.  1.sql will correspond to schema version
1.  2.sql will migrate to version 2, etc.


It's still very much a work in progress.


To set it up:

-Copy "management" into a django application directory (any application in
your project).

-Add a "db" directory

-create a "schema_version" table:

 CREATE TABLE "schema_version" (
   "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "upgrade_timestamp" timestamp with time zone,
    "new_version" varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    "comment" varchar(200) NULL
 )

-create a 1.sql with your first migration in it.

-run "python manage.py upgrade -n 1 -e" to perform the upgrade.
