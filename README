django-simple-migration is a very simple schema migrator for 
Django.  Yes, there are a few existing migration options.  Most
attempt to write SQL for you and, imho, do too much.

I wanted something that let me write a SQL or Python file for each
upgrade and then would run them as needed, keeping track of what
version it was currently on.  So I wrote it.  This does exactly that
and nothing else.

It's still very much a work in progress, but is functional and
actively used for at least two sites.



To set it up:

-Copy "management" into a django application directory (any application in
your project).

-Add a "db" directory

-create a "schema_version" table:

 CREATE TABLE "schema_version" (
   "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "upgrade_timestamp" timestamp with time zone,
    "new_version" varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    "comment" varchar(200) NULL
 )

-create a 1.sql with your first migration in it.

-run "python manage.py upgrade -n 1 -e" to perform the upgrade.
