django-simple-migration is a very simple schema migrator for 
Django.  Yes, there are a few different existing migration libraries.
I wanted something that let me write a SQL or Python file for each
upgrade and then would run them as needed, keeping track of what
version it was currently on.  So I wrote it.  This does exactly that
and nothing else.

It's still very much a work in progress, but is functional and
actively used for at least two production sites.


To install:

-copy the "management" folder into your django project.

-add 'project.migration' to the INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py

-create a 1.sql with your first migration in it.
 (there's an example one in there which creates a new table)

-run "python manage.py upgrade -n 1 -e" to perform the upgrade.


That's it.  For future migrations, create 2.sql, 3.sql, etc.
You can also have migrations which are python files; simply
create 2.py, 3.py, etc.


If you want to use the admin app to view the migrations that
have been run on your project, uncomment the admin.py and
replace PROJECT_NAME with your project's name.

Similarly, to use syncdb functionality, replace PROJECT_NAME in
migration/management/__init__.py
